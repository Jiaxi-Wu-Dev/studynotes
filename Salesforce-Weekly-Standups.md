**Week 2**

Business Process is your bread and butter

What is a thing that a business wants to do and what are the steps that the business takes to get it done.

marketing is a funnel, try to create as many leads as possible
Marketing team finds leads

Events, Webinars, Social Media, Paid Ads, Referrals -> Leads

Sales qualifies the leads from marketing -> convert it to an account, contact, or opportunity

Recruiting is a form of sales

contacts are people
accounts are organizations

lead -> qualify it -> convert to account

Salesforce comes with out of the box processes but you can create specific processes via Path for any object

Lead Stages
Open - Not Contacted -> Working - Contacted -> Closed - Not Converted -> Converted

Opportunity Stages
Prospecting -> Qualification -> Needs Analysis -> Value Proposition -> ID Decision Makers -> Perception Analysis -> Proposal/Price/Quote -> Negotiation/Review -> Closed - Won or Lost

Opportunity - an active sales cycle that will require time and effort to close

Leads are anyone who is out there who could possibly interest in buying your stuff. If we find out they can buy it and actually have an interest, we convert them to a contact. They then get more attention from the sales team

Vocab This Week -
Lead
Contact
Account
Opportunity
Campaign
Parent Campaign
Case Assignment Rule
Escalation Rule

Monitering activity is IMPORTANT, helps to convert

Two types of activities
Task - something with a due date
Event - kinda like salesforce weekly meetings, its an event

MQL = Marketing Qualified Leads
SQL = Sales Qualified Leads
MQL might look good on paper, e.g. have the right job title or demographic data, so the marketing team adds them to a campaign. But when passed to Sales, they need to requalify them to see. ifthey're actually interested.
