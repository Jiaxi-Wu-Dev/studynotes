Package - a way to organize your java projects, for now consider them as folders with learnprogramming in our example being a subfolder of academy. Companies use their domain names reversed.

Data types are divided into two groups:

    Primitive data types - includes byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char
    Non-primitive data types - such as String, Arrays and Classes (you will learn more about these in a later chapter)

Java Syntax

Byte occupies 8 bits, a byte hasa width of 8

A short can store 16 bits and a width of 16

A int occupies 32bits and has a width of 32

To Create a Integer
int myFirstnumber = 5

To Print Something onto the console
System.out.println()

Maximum Value
Integer.MAX_VALUE;

Minimum Value
Integer.Min_VALUE;

Byte Maximum Value
byte myMaxByteValue = Byte.MAX_VALUE;

Byte Minimum Value
Byte.MIN_VALUE;

short myMinShortValue = Short.MIN_VALUE;

long myMaxLongValue = Long.MAX_VALUE;

Single and Double Precision
Single Precision occupies 32bits

Double precision occupies 64bits

Float
float myMinFloatValue = Float.MIN_VALUE;

Final Variables - final keyword if you dont want others or yourself to overwrite existing values
final int myNum = 15;

Examples of Variable types
int myNum = 5;
float myFloatNum = 5.99f;
char myLetter = 'D';
boolean myBool = true;
String myText = "Hello";
